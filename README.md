# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time.

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates.

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Reflection

To generate paths I use a state machine which takes as input data about its environment from sensor fusion and which decides finally which lane to take at which speed. Generally I implemented the state machine in a way so that it prefers to use right lanes in general and to pass other vehicles it prefers to pass left.

To get an overview of other cars on the road I first cluster them dependent on the lane relative to the current position. This means I have a vector of
* Cars in front of my car (`vector < car > front_cars`)
* Cars left of me (`vector < car > left_cars`)
* Cars on the right (`vector < car > right_cars`)

`car` is a class I defined to have an overview of all relevant data without having to car about indices in sensor fusion data:
```
struct car{
  double x;
  double y;
  double s;
  double predicted_s;
  double d;
  double yaw;
  double speed;
};
```

To see whether a lane is blocked or not I define a corridor of 10 m behind my car and 30 m in front of me to ensure a safe lane change. If any car is within this corridor I inhibit a lane change in the state machine and wait for all vehicles to pass. If a lane is occupied or not is indicated in `right_lane_blocked` and `left_lane_blocked` variables.

I also adapt the speed of my car and slow down in case a slower vehicle is in front of me. To ensure this I assign the target vehicle speed (`speed_tar`) to the slower vehicle speed of the car in front. To ensure a smooth transition without violating jerk limits I increment my speed set point (`speed_sp`) until it reaches the target vehicle speed. Same is done for accelerations as well.

To give a smooth path I then use a spline function (http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/) through three upcoming waypoints in 30 m, 60 m and 90 m in front of me. My points on this function are used then until 30 m in front of me. Smoothening is ensured by using previous paths and only adding new waypoints to fill the the points which have been passed within one cycle. This also reduced the number of points which have to be added to the path which makes calculation more efficient.

The current solution succeeds in navigating through the traffic without causing accident or violating speed or jerk limits. However sometimes the car doesn't find the smartest or fastest possible path through the traffic. To achieve this I will add a cost function which decides dependent on average lane speed on which side to pass most efficiently.
